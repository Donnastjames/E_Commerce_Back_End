# E_Commerce_Back_End

## Description
This is a backend application that keeps track of inventory in a database using `Express.js` API. I used association methods to create relationships between the Product, Category, Tag and ProductTag models in order to perform REST API calls that would allow a user to save, create, update and delete data from a database.  I also used the `dotenv` package to store my `MySQL` username, password and database name to protect sensitive data.

## Installation
Install `Node.js` - https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/ 

`Express`, `dotenv`, `MySql2`, `Sequelize` and `Nodemon` were installed through `npm install`.

## Usage
The user can save, create, update and delete Products, Tags and Categories from the database, using `Insomnia` to make the REST API calls.
